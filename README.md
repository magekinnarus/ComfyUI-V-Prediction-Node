# ComfyUI-V-Prediction-Node
Node to set v-prediction sampling when using SDXL and other models that may not have the necessary metadata to identify it as a v-prediction model.
This node is useful for quantized models since they lack the necessary metadata.

### The basic workflow
The workflow is simple.

1. Add the "AddParam" node to your ComfyUI workflow.

2. Connect the "AddParam" node to the model loader node (e.g., the UNetLoader).
  
3. Select "epsilon" or "v_prediction" from the dropdown menu.
